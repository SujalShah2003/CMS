                As India was making history across the world, it was also under the clutches of a highly potent variant of COVID-19- the Delta variant. The country began its vaccination drive on January 16, 2021, for healthcare workers which were later extended to people over 60 years of age and those above 45 with specific comorbidities. In the next phase from April, vaccinations for all above the age of 45 years was approved and finally, it was expanded for everyone above 18 years of age from May 1.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first big milestone came when India decided to celebrate PM Modi's birthday in September with a landmark number of vaccinations. The country successfully achieved the feat by vaccinating a record-breaking number of 2.5 crore citizens on a single day on September 17.
