                The country was shaken as a grisly murder case came to light in November this year. Aftab Amin Poonawala, who was in a live-in relationship and lived with his partner Shraddha Walkar in Delhi's Chhatarpur area, strangled and killed her in the flat.

                He later dismembered the corpse into 35 pieces and stacked them in a refrigerator, especially bought for the purpose, and disposed them in various parts of the city at midnight. 
                <br>
                <br>
                He was arrested by the Delhi Police and underwent a polygraph test and narco analysis and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail.
