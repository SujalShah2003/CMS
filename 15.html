                While the first month of the year was dominated by the Covid-scare, the world suddenly transitioned to another one with Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24 in what Vladimir Putin called a "special military operation". Several Indian students were left stranded in the country who managed to reach Poland and Hungary's borders from where they were evacuated and brought back to the country.

                The invasion has been followed by missile strikes from both sides and sanctions by the West and counter-sanctions by Russia.

                <br>
                Both sides have suffered huge losses since the war started. As per a report by Al Jazeera, Russia has suffered with its economy reducing in the third quarter of this year by 7.1 per cent compared with before sanctions in the fourth quarter of last year. While Ukraine revealed its estimates of military deaths at 10,000 to 13,000 earlier this month since the start of the war and the United Nations estimated 17,000 civilian deaths.
