                    <p>What is a CMS?</p><br>
                    <p>'A CMS is a technological tool that you can use to create websites on a web server. It has enough functions to enable both laymen and experts to create and keep track of their content. Different CMS platforms provide different tools to help achieve flexibility and ease of use when building a website.'</p>

                    <p>What do you think are the benefits of using a CMS platform?</p><br>
                    <p>'CMS platforms can make uploading and updating content very easy, especially for people who are not technically proficient. They are user-friendly, can be quickly deployed, have SEO-friendly features and allow easy website maintenance. Most open-source CMS platforms are also cost efficient and work using a plugin and extensions model. They have a strong developer community that offers extensive support to all users.'</p>

                    <p>What is the purpose of using a CMS and what are its applications?</p><br>
                    <p>'CMS platforms are primarily used for creating, managing and optimising the digital experience for users and audiences. They also allow multiple people to create and have access to stored data, encouraging collaboration between different creators.'</p>

                    <p>Is there any difference between standard and more expensive CMS platforms? If so, what might these differences be?</p><br>
                    <p>'The price of a CMS platform often reflects the variety of features that it offers. The majority of users may find that they only use the most basic features consistently. Most CMS platforms offer a free version of their application, and these often provide all the basic features required for a non-technical user to run a complex website. If a user's requirements are beyond the basics, then they can consider expanding their budget and purchasing a more expensive CMS.'</p>

                    <p>'You can divide CMS platforms into six main categories based on their respective domains of use. These are enterprise CMS, web CMS, document management system, media CMS and mobile CMS. CMS platforms are also classified as open-source, software-as-a-service and cloud-based platforms.'</p>

                    <p>Does CMS usability vary with the type of content you want to create?</p><br>
                    <p>'Yes, the usability of different CMS platforms varies greatly with the type of content you may want to create. Several systems offer exclusive options for static or word-based content. Other platforms provide additional support for video-based content without impacting the website speed or customer experience.'</p>

                    <p>Can you explain the difference between posts and pages?</p><br>
                    <p>'Users of CMS platforms provide timely published content by creating social media posts or blog updates. These posts typically have a publishing date and appear in reverse chronological order on a blog page. Some examples of posts include individual reviews, discussions or blogs on a specific topic. In contrast, you would publish unchanging, static website content on a page, which does not typically have a publishing date. Examples of website pages include the 'About Us' page, the 'FAQ' page and the 'Contact Us' page.'</p>

                    <p>Which CMS do you prefer and why?</p><br>
                    <p>'There are many CMS platforms available in the market, such as WordPress, Drupal and Joomla, but my preferred choice is WordPress. It has transformed from a blogging platform to a fully-fledged CMS for website development and is very easy to use, even for users who have little to no experience using coding and other technical software. I prefer WordPress because I can combine it with a wide range of themes and plugins to deliver an optimal user experience. It has several options for different types of websites, content delivery network support and security-enhancing plugins.'</p>

                    <p>Which CMS do you prefer and why?</p><br>
                    <p>'UI stands for user interface design and involves customising the design of a website so that it is visually more appealing and user-friendly. UX stands for user experience and involves assessing how customers receive a website and incorporating user feedback to improve usability.'
                    <br>
                    'UI is responsible for the quality of the users' experience of the website. It guides the user through website functionalities across different platforms. UX is responsible for analysing how users react to the website. It includes hands-on work like researching, testing, development, cataloguing and prototyping, with the aim of enriching the user experience. UX does not require a technical background, though it can help if you have one.'
