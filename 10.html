                An Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter with Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat on board crashed in the first week of December near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, the IAF said, as four people were killed in the mishap that happened reportedly due to low visibility owing to foggy conditions. Later it was confirmed that General Bipin Rawat along with his wife, Madhulika Rawat had succumbed to their injuries following the Mi-17VH chopper crash.

                The accident site was a scene of despair with trees being reduced to broken pieces under the impact of the crash, flames from the chopper engulfing the wooden logs resulting in billowing smoke and personnel scurrying to douse the fire, including using buckets and water hoses. What seemed to be some charred bodies were also seen lying around.
