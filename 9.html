                Aryan Khan, the son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan was mired in controversy and continued to dominate the news in the later half of 2021 after he was accused of doing drugs along with his friends inside the Cordelia Cruise.

                <br>
                 Following the incident, Aryan was arrested on October 3 by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and was lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail for 22 days. Aryan Khan along with many others was accused of consumption and ‘conspiracy’ and was booked under other charges.

                 <br>
                 After making several rounds to the court followed by days of legal arguments centred around the consumption of drugs, on October 28, the Bombay High Court granted Aryan Khan bail. Aryan Khan’s incident had once more opened the floodgates around Bollywood’s drug racket, which had also dominated the news last year following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.
