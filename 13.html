                In the field of glamour, India's Harnaaz Sandhu made the nation proud by bagging the long yearned-for Miss Universe title at the 70th edition of the beauty pageant event in December.
                <br>
                <br>
                 Harnaaz brought home the prestigious honour, 21 years after Lara Dutta won it in the year 2000. Sandhu was crowned Miss Universe 2021 in a glitzy ceremony held at the Red Sea port of Eilat by her predecessor Andrea Meza of Mexico.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                  Apart from Miss Universe, the 21-year-old has multiple pageant titles to her name including Femina Miss India Punjab in 2019 and Femina Miss India 2019, where she was placed as a semi-finalist.
