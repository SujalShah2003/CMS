                Team India gave its best-ever Olympics performance at Tokyo 2020 this year, bagging 7 medals and surpassing its previous medal tallies. With the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020-21 and its accompanying challenges, the accomplishments of Indian athletes at the Tokyo 2020 not only helped make the country proud but also ignited hope and aspiration for the future.

                At the centre of the historic achievement was India's star javelin thrower, Neeraj Chopra who ended the country's century-long wait of winning a Gold medal in athletics. The victory also helped India surpass its previous best haul of six medals achieved in the 2012 London Games
