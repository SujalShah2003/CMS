                India's next big achievement came a month later in October, when the nation's COVID-19 vaccination coverage crossed the 100-crore number, marking a 'Vaccine Century'. There were celebrations across the world to honour the momentous occasion.

                To commemorate the special day, India's largest khadi tricolour weighing around 1,400 kg, was hoisted from the Red Fort. Domestic airline SpiceJet unveiled a special livery to honour the contribution of frontline workers and corona warriors who helped India administer 100 crore vaccine doses. Three Boeing 737 aircraft bearing images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and healthcare workers were inaugurated. As of December 22, Indiaâ€™s COVID-19 vaccination coverage has exceeded 138.96 Crore (1,38,95,90,670).
